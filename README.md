# Image-Classification-using-Resnet34
The following notebook trains a neural network classifier based on Resnet34 that is able to differentiate between 120 different species of dogs with over 85% accuracy. The network is trained using the fast.ai library which is built on top of pytorch. The Stanford Dogs Dataset is utilized for training.
